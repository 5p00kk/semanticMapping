# Semantic mapping
___
### Description
___
The goal of this project is to provide a full semantic mapping solution. It is based on a fusion of deep learning image segmnetation algorithm (Mask-RCNN) and SLAM algorithm (RTAB-Map). 
Additionally few algorithms are provided for semantic pointcloud processing to prove usefulness of the concept and the solution.

The proposed solution is based on exisiting repositories with rtabmap and Mask-RCNN implementations. For clarity, in this repository, only modified files of these repos are included.
